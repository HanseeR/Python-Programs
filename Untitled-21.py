# Variable and data types in Python
# Defining different types of variables

# Integer, Float, String, Boolean
a = 5          # Integer
b = 4.5        # Float
c = 'geeksforgeeks'  # String
d = True       # Boolean

A = 10         # Another Integer

# Python is case-sensitive, so 'a' and 'A' are different variables

# Basic operations in Python
# Addition operation
add_val = a + A 

# Display result of addition
print("Addition of a and A is:", add_val)
